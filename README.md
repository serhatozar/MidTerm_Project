# MidTerm_Project - Seller Performance of an Amazon Retailer to the EU and outside of the EU


We are working with one real dataset (9539 rows x 96 columns) sourced by eVat TAX compliance start-up. The dataset depicts all of the sales of one Amazon Retail Seller Shop for the year of 2022. We want to gain insights on how the seller is doing based on revenue, customers, different products, countries, shipping options, warehouses etc. and visualize our findings with Tableau.

Challenge

Write Python code and build a Tableau Dashboard to perform the following tasks using the eVAT Amazon Seller database:
1.	We have many redundant columns and many that receive NULL values or different formats that need to be cleaned or transformed into the values that we can work with.
2.	Then we need to focus on which features will be help us to gain insight on the seller’s performance (e.g. Metrics and KPIs) on the platform. Which might be ‘revenue’, ‘customer’, ‘product_id’, ‘country’, ‘shipping’, ‘warehouse’ etc.
3.	After getting satisfied with the updated data, our focus will be on the relations of the features that we have, and to bring them into the format that we can work with and visualize meaningful and easy to read information on Tableau.
4.	In Tableau, the next challenge will be to group the correct information, create new calculated new fields and organize charts and metrics on a dashboard.

Submission

•	Upon completion,we will hand in our work with the fully commented notebook of the cleaned dataset and the final link to the dashboard.
